# no-permission-write
C++ implementation of no permission file write

ï»¿The program takes in several command line arguments and it will write them to a file with no permissions

The command line arguments are as follows:
1. File name (the file with no permissions which we want to write the information to)
2. Option -c clears the file and writes the message to the file

All other text that is at the command line arguments is considered as text to be inputted into the file, no need to quote the text. The program will work if the text is quoted!

Example Run is located in the Example_Run file
